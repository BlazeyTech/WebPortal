WebPortal
=========
WebPortal is designed to be an easy to use, time saving HTML/CSS editor. It has some key tools which will 
help make it a comptetive tool.

- Intellisense (Not working correctly)
- Browser Preview (Not working)
- Shortcuts toolbar
- HTML Tags menu
- Countless forms handling specific tags and features.

The best way to describe WebPortal is by trying it out. Please give me some feedback, and sorry for how it's 
unfinished in many ways. I have been the only person working on it up until this point.
